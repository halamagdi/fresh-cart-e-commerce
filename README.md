# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The E-commerce Web Application is a feature-rich platform that allows users to explore and purchase products from an online store. The application is built using React, JSX, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Javascript. It integrates with an API to GET, POST, and UPDATE data related to products, user authentication, and order processing.
